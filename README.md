IntelHexParser
==============

C++ Intel Hex Parser

ONLY RECORD TYPES 0x0 AND 0x1 ARE SUPPORTED

The IntelHexParser library automatically handles the parsing of files in the Intel Hex File Format.  This project was originally started as part of a AVR I2C Bootloader and then moved to a seperate library.  The library currently is only compiled to a dynamic library (*.so).  More information on how to use the library can be found in INSTALL.
