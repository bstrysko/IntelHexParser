IntelHexParser
==============

C++ Intel Hex Parser


The IntelHexParser library automatically handles the parsing of files in the Intel Hex File Format.  This project was originally started as part of a AVR I2C Bootloader and then moved to a seperate library.  The library currently is only compiled to a static library (*.a).  More information on how to use the library can be found in INSTALL.
